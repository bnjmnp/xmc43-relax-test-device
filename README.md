# XMC4300 Relax Test Device

This project was spin-off the `xmc4300_slavedemo` from `SOES\applications\`.

EtherCAT slave device firmware for the [XMC4300 Relax EtherCATÂ® Kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/kit_xmc43_relax_ecat_v1/).

The board can then be used as test device for automated tests of EtherCAT master systems.

The firmware uses the [Simple Open Source EtherCAT Slave](https://github.com/OpenEtherCATsociety/SOES) EtherCAT slave stack.
